# GigConomy : Decentralized Freelancing Platform for Global Gig Economy ü§ù

## Problem we are solving:

**‚ÄúTrust‚Äù** is a key factor for successful transactions between parties. To ensure trust, we involve third party freelancing platforms or middlemen and pay hefty commissions which highly affect the overall profit margins of parties involved in a transaction.

**GigConomy** : Decentralized Freelancing Platform for Global Gig Economy ü§ù which helps individuals and businesses to grow globally and increase profit margins in four simple steps:

**1) List Products,Services or subscription packages.**

**2) Create Escrow agreements with personalize terms as per customers.**

**3) Send/Receive crypto payments in a reliable and secure way without
paying hefty commissions to third parties.**

**4) Trust Score: Rate your experience of working with each other and
get rewarded for best Trust Score.**

## List of Bounties implemented:

**‚≠ì Polygon with Spheron:** We have used Polygon Mumbai Testnet for deploying smart contracts of
**1) Escrow Agreement**
**2) Chainklink VRF**
**3) Chainlink Price Feed.**
**‚ö´ Spheron:** We have used Spheron Decentralized cloud to host our Dapp using Pinta storage integration of Spheron.

**‚õìÔ∏è Chainlink: We have used Chainlink 1) Price Feed 2) Chainlink VRF**

**Chainlink Price feed** is used to convert the price of tokens such as Matic to USD, Ether to USD while the user creates invoices for their customers.

**Chainlink VRF** is used to generate a random number for the series of invoices the user creates.

**üíæ IPFS/Filecoin NFT.Storage:** We are Using Web3.Storage, to permanently store all the details of user invoices and subscription service on decentralized storage.

**Biconomy:** Using Biconomy, we have implemented 1) **Hyphen Bridge** for fast and secure transfer of assets from Polygon to Ethereum and vice versa 2) **Enabled Gasless transactions** for Escrow Agreement functionality. When buyers or sellers stake their crypto assets in Escrow agreement, our Dapp will pay gas behalf of users through Biconomy Gas Tank to provide seamless experience to users.

**Challenges we have faced:** When we started building, we had so many ideas for features and functionalities to implement in Trustified.Netowork. We had too many ideas like we can build a freelancing platform, we can build a review system for businesses and so on. As a startup we knew that too many features or trying to cover too many use cases at once will confuse the users and implemented minimum possible features to solve one use case.
